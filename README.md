# Reference on Rails

## What?
This repo is meant to serve as a cheat sheet on rails! Because OOP centers around the idea of creating digital representations of the real world, I represented one of my favorite things: :mountain_bicyclist: bikes!

## Why? 
I'm creating this repo as an application of the [Feynman Technique](https://medium.com/taking-note/learning-from-the-feynman-technique-5373014ad230) in order to deepen not only my understanding of the topic, but how to communicate it.  I'll be starting off with the more common methods, syntaxes, and tasks (migrations, generators, controllers, etc.) and then working up to more complex topics.

## How?
My plan is to create a biking app to represent the creation and sale of bikes from a variety of manufacturers & retail stores to various customers. I'll be adding in all the logic necessary for the app while adding in comments for other relevant information within the file.

## Send It!
If you have an idea for a topic you'd like to see covered here, raise an issue and I'll keep adding to this as I can.
